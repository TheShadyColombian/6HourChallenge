### Planed Features

After briefly playtesting the game, I came up with the following changes that I'd like to make to the game:

- Changes to game mechanics:
    - [x] Make Viruses eat the Red Blood Cells instead of having them be idle.
    - [x] If a Virus consumes a Red Blood Cell, a score penalty is applied.
    - [x] Consuming Viruses extends the player's momentum.
    - Turn system overhaul:
        - [x] Change the turns system to use an analog bar instead of a fixed number of turns.
        - [x] Make the turns bar deplete on its own to disincentivize camping/farming.
    - Boost system overhaul:
        - [x] Display boost direction and force as the player charges the boost.
        - [x] Apply drag to player movement.
        - [x] The longer a boost is charged for, the more of the turn bar is depleted.
- Fixes/improvements:
    - [x] Fix UI canvases to properly scale dynamically.
    - [x] Add juice to players consuming Viruses/Red Blood Cells.
    
### Unplanned Extra Features

The following features were added during the 6 hour window which weren't originally planned, but either came up organically during the development process or were deemed necessary while playtesting:

- Replace UI assets.
- Font change throughout the UI (now using [Indestructible Type](https://indestructibletype.com/)'s [Gnomon](https://indestructibletype.com/Gnomon.html) font).
- Spawn enemies in bursts with delay inbetween each enemy in the burst.
- Preview the amount of energy that will be consumed in the movement bar.
- Added background graphic so that walls are visible
- QOL: If a player clicks/taps for a tiny fraction of time (accidental double-click, bad debounce settings, etc.) the action is ignored, energy is refunded and previous velocity is maintained
- Added hitfreeze alongside camera shake
- Made player trail opacity fade as velocity reaches 0
- Reworked shake system
- Vibration when entities are consumed (untested)

### Post-Challenge

Since the challenge is over, I won't continue to update this repo anymore (except to add links to new branches or forks, if necessary). There are still some things I want to do with this project. If I ever get around to implementing them, these changes will be tracked in [a different branch](https://github.com/DaskalosJSM/6HoursChallenge/tree/JuanCallejas_PostChallenge), or perhaps even a fork, so take a look there for new changes. Here are some of the changes I've already started considering:

- Fancy animated transitions between screens (main menu/game/game over)
- Animations for the player and various entities for when they are consumed, when the player is launched or bounces, etc.
- High score storage for display on Game Over screen (I was hoping to do this during the challenge, but I ran out of time when implementing the screenshake and hitfreeze)
- Sound effects are always a welcome addition and definitely improve the game feel, so if I find a way to obtain some sound effects it would be great to add those as well.
